Finally tired of all the blog templates I've found (they're pretty good, don't get me wrong), I'm going to be building this one from scratch. I probably won't migrate off of [emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca) yet, but I hope to do so soon.

What I plan to use to build this:

- Astro
- Tailwind
- Bit of React probably (reusable components)

Todos:

- Wireframe
- First WIP
- Decide on colour scheme
- ???
- Profit
